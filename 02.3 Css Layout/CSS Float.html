<img src="Images/css-logo.gif" style="float: left" alt="css"/>
<img src="Images/css-logo.gif" style="float: left" alt="css"/>
<span style="color: red">As you can see they were palced one next to the other. Also note that THIS whole red text appears in code AFTER the images</span>
<br/>
<br/>

<img src="Images/css-logo.gif" style="float: left; clear: both" alt="css"/>
<img src="Images/css-logo.gif" style="float: left; clear: both" alt="css"/>
<span style="color: red">As you can see now the images are not placed one next to the other because the clear rule prevents this. Yet the red text keeps on showind BEFORE them, although the ame rule is applied</span>
